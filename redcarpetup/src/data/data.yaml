tagline: "Never worry about funds again! Just download RedCarpet."

About1: "RedCarpet lends to customers in India to finance their online purchases - ecommerce, travel, etc. In India, credit and finance companies are able to service less than 3% of the customer base because there is no data, no widespread credit bureaus to profile and score customers. RedCarpet has access to much more data, including data on your mobile phone. We use this data to service customers who never had any access to credit before.
90% of ecommerce in India is cash on delivery. That is almost 4 billion USD of credit floating around - but not managed and packaged as credit  and risk. What it means is that we are building structure around something that already happens at a large scale in India… just not built right."

About2: "By building better credit & lending infrastructure, we want to enable more people to access credit. Our job starts BEFORE you start using a payment gateway or a wallet - we believe the basic problem in the trillion dollar Indian economy is access to liquidity. Our aim is to expand the credit economy — simply replacing the legacy credit providers/banks would probably be a great business success, but it’s not all that interesting as a goal."

privacy: "We use your data to determine your “credit limit” (just like Siri listens to your voice to be a better assistant). Your personal and financial data are encrypted - even while using your phone - to ensure that it stays safe when you use RedCarpet."

guarantee: "If you have any problem with the delivery of the order, we will work with our ecommerce partners to fix that for you or will refund you the entire cost, as long as the eligibility requirements are met."

protection: "Your security is our top priority. We monitor every account and transaction 24*7 to prevent fraud. We never sell your data outside RedCarpet."

legal: "RedCarpet works with several financial institutions like banks and we make sure that our collection and recovery processes are fully compliant. If your experience has been otherwise, please reach out to us at support@redcarpetup.com and we will figure out what went wrong."
